# Build Your Own Website - A Beginner's Guide


## Overview
Build Your Own Website is a short tutorial for complete beginners in HTML and CSS. It covers the very basics of HTML and CSS.

Please feel free to use/fork this tutorial for your own training sessions - feedback welcome!

This is a project that I have to do for my Fintech course on DevOps. This project is still in progress.  

## Build Your Own Website - Part 1 - HTML

we'll create our own webpage from first principles, learning in the process how web pages are built.

## (1) View Source
Go to http://www.wikipedia.org/ and select 'View Source' from the browser. This option can be found under:
Google Chrome: right-click on page -> View page source
Internet Explorer: right-click on page -> View source
Firefox: right-click on page -> View Page Source
Look for the following lines:
<title ...
We can see that a webpage is defined by lots of text instructions - this is HTML
       
## (2) Example HTML
We're going to start with a basic webpage.

Open up a text editor:

Notepad (Windows)
Enter the following text  
   <img width="600" alt="html" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84313183/124280066-d3276700-db7a-11eb-90bb-dbeba2794873.png">
   

Save this file as index.html on your computer, and then double-click on the file from within the file explorer to launch your web browser and view the file.
The browser will display a blank page, because at the moment, although our web page contains some text, it does not contain any displayable text, only markup.

## (3) Title
We'll now change the title of the page so that the browser displays the page title in the system menu.

Back in the text editor, change the text to look like this:
       
       
       
Save the file, and refresh the page in your browser. You should see that the page title (in the tab, or in the system menu) now says 'xxxxxx'.
       

       
##(4) Heading
We'll now add a heading, making some text appear in the page.

Back in the text editor, change the text to look like this:

Save the file, and refresh the page in your browser. You should see that the page now displays a heading (in bold): 'I built my own web page!'.
